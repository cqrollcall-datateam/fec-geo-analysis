# Analyzing geography of FEC contributions
## By Sean McMinn

With the swell in Democratic House challengers for 2018, we looked at where they are finding early financial support. The first story published as a result of this analysis ran in Roll Call on Sept. 7 and was written by Sean McMinn and Simone Pathe: [House Challengers Find Fundraising Success Outside Their Districts](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/2018-democrats-house-fundraising-challengers)

The Jupyter Notebook analysis using the FEC's API and Census Bureau's CSV data can be found in [check_geo_FEC.ipynb](https://github.com/cqrollcall-datateam/fec-geo-analysis/blob/master/check_geo_analysis.ipynb). An initial listing of House Democratic challengers compiled by the Roll Call politics team is at [d_challengers.csv](https://github.com/cqrollcall-datateam/fec-geo-analysis/blob/master/d_challengers.csv).
