# Analyzing geography of FEC contributions

With the swell in Democratic House challengers for 2018, we looked at where they are finding early financial support. The first story publisehd as a result of this analysis ran in Roll Call on Sept. 7 and was written by Sean McMinn and Simone Pathe: [House Challengers Find Fundraising Success Outside Their Districts](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/2018-democrats-house-fundraising-challengers)

The Jupyter Notebook analysis using the FEC's API and Census Bureau's CSV data can be found in [check_geo_FEC.ipynb]().
